# Spitify


This program is a simple version of a music streaming service to learn concepts about 
object oriented programming. There are users that need to login and who 
can then create playlists of songs and play them, and the songs need 
to be part of a library that the application maintains. By using 
object-oriented design and object-oriented programming Spitify is made  
robust, extensible, and easy to maintain.
